# TODO

## NOW -- bugs, problems


## SOON -- improvements

- treat some elements as environments:
    - blockquote, footnote, dl, ul/ol?
    - don't assume all elements under, eg, blockquote are paragraphs
    - define li (different for ul/ol)

- combine current input files into single comprehensive test

- make correct elements for <a> link?


## LATER -- features
