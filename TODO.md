# TODO

## NOW -- bugs, problems

- automatically inherit styles from root environment
    - eg, para
    - look up env/style in Environments first, then find style
    - only create style when used

- add root 'item' style, to use as base for other items?
    - space before/after = 1p, space between = 0p


## SOON -- improvements

- make correct elements for <a> link?


## LATER -- features
